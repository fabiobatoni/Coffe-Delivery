## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Challenge Overview

<img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fabiobatoni/Coffe-Delivery/5f4e335b566aae9e297ff364cee92851a455aabe/src/assets/HomeLogo.svg" width="400"/>


In this challenge, you will develop an application to manage a shopping cart for a fictional coffee shop, which contains the following features:

- List of products (coffees) available for purchase
- Add a specific number of items to the cart
- Increase or remove the number of items in the cart
- Form for the user to fill in their address
- Display the total items in the cart in the Header
- Display the total value of the sum of items in the cart multiplied by the value

Although there are few features, you will need to remember concepts such as:

- States
- ContextAPI
- LocalStorage
- Immutability of the state
- Lists and keys in ReactJS
- Properties
- Componentization

To complete this challenge, you may need to do research to learn about array manipulation methods such as `reduce`, which will be extremely useful for calculating the total value of the cart.

### 1.2 Application layout

For this application we provide a layout so that you can follow and implement all the features designed in figma. 

To access Figma, you must first create an account on the platform.

## 2. Getting Started for Developers

To set up a local copy of this repository:

- For SSH (recommended for secure, key-based authentication), use:

  ```bash
  git@github.com:fabiobatoni/Coffe-Delivery.git
  ```

- For HTTPS (simpler setup, ideal for quick trials), use:

  ```bash
  https://github.com/fabiobatoni/Coffe-Delivery.git
  ```

### 2.1 Installation

Follow these steps to set up the Reav front page environment on your local
machine:

1. **Clone the Repository and Change Directory**

```bash

### 2.2 Local Development

**Prerequisite**

- Before you begin, check the version of `node` by running the command `node
--version`. According to "Minimum Runtime Requirements", **TypeScript** requires
`node` version 18.17.1 or later.

To start the Reav front page, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Application**

Use the commands to run:

- Development environment

```bash
npm run dev
```

2. **Access the Application**

Once the server is running, open your preferred web browser and navigate to:

- [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
